## Overview

Welcome to the React Redux Practice repository! This project serves as a hands-on practice for implementing Redux and Redux Toolkit in a simple React application. The app simulates an e-commerce platform with products that can be added to a shopping cart. The cart data is then sent to Firebase, ensuring persistence even when the page is refreshed.

### Key Features:

- **Product Listing:** View a list of products with placeholders (no images).
- **Add to Cart:** Use the "Add to Cart" function to add products to your shopping cart.
- **Firebase Integration:** Cart data is sent to Firebase for persistence.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- Firebase

```
git clone https://github.com/Hasnat-Ahmed-Goheer/React-redux-practice.git
```
2. Install dependencies:

```
cd React-redux-practice
npm install
```
3. Set up Firebase:
  - Create a project on Firebase.
  - Obtain your Firebase configuration.
  - Paste the configuration in src/firebase.js.

4. Run the app:
```
npm start
```
7. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

## Configuring Firebase
